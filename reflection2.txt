1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	To start commits, and all other git functions, it needs to be first initialized


2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	
	The working area is files that have not yet been committed or interacted with git. Repository are officially committed files.Staging is 
	what connects the working area to the repostiory

3)How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	
	use the "git status" command to see what is in your current staging area and if they accomplish the same task

4)What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	
	branches are labelled so you can keep track of your history much easier

5) How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	You can see the path they come from, as well as when certain commits diverged (branched)

6) What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

	Everything in the non-master branch will be added to the master branch. its represented that way because it shows the branches now share 
	one path. they are merged.
