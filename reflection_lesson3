1)When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When you don't have consistent access to the same computer that your repository is locally sotred. 
  Accessible from anywhere this way.



 "A remote in your local repository is a reference to another repository"

2)Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?


   Your file may not yet be ready to be commited. Or sometimes the any changes
   to the file may be small enough to not warrant a commit.

3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

   Fork: clones from one github repository to a new github repository. makes explicit reference to the cloned repository.

   Clone: copies the repository; can be both github or local. 

   Branch: creates a new reference to a commit within the same repository

4) What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

   You work on the last known state offline. youre not depending on an internet connection.
